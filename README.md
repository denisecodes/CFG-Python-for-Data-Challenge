# CFG Python for Data Challenge
In this repo, I attempted to solve the CFG Python for Data MOOC Challenge to analyze data for Product Sales. I used pandas and plotly to solve this challenge.

You can find the slide deck which summarises key findings and data visualisations I made as part of the project [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H1Mo8I2FH0B8ns2krz6KaeWGeUESrRMYs5RmpcwSTDI/edit?usp=sharing).

## Feedback from the Instructor: 
<ul>
  <li>Nice looking slide deck, but try using a lighter background with darker font colour or vice-versa. The current one makes it bit hard to read the slide text sometimes, such as slide 3.</li>
  <li>Nice and beautiful plots. Out of all the submission, this is first one which uses plotly. And good observation about fitbit and wrong categorisation-   good inputs.</li>
  <li>Great use of Jupyter Notebook's markdowns and clear explanations.</li>
  <li>Customer with most sales calculation might be bit wrong, but I understand the question itself wasn't absolutely clear about it either
Great work overall!</li>

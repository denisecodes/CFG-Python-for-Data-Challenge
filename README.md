# CFG Python for Data Challenge
In this repo, I attempted to solve the CFG Python for Data MOOC Challenge to analyze data for Product Sales. I used pandas and plotly to solve this challenge.

You can find the slide deck I made as part of the project [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H1Mo8I2FH0B8ns2krz6KaeWGeUESrRMYs5RmpcwSTDI/edit?usp=sharing).
